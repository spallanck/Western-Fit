# WesternFit
This is a simple fitness tracker that allows you to track your workouts. Along the way, we will exercise using floating action buttons, RecyclerView to display a list of items, Fragments as reusable pieces of UI, as well as Dialog boxes with input types such as date pickers and number pickers and spinners.
